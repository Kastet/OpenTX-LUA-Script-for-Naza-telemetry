# OpenTX LUA Script for Naza telemetry

## Motivation

You must be enjoing flying your aircraft powered of DJI Naza flight controller and driven by a radio with OpenTX operating system. Then these LUA scripts are a neat way to display important telemetry data on your radio. 

This is re-worked and improved version of scripts created by Richard@hetnet.nl and inspired by this video https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=es96gNxcxO0

## Installation

1. Make sure 'simulation' variable is set to '0' before you upload the scripts to your radio
2. Rename the scripts folder to match your model name (F450 in my case)
3. Copy BMP and the scripts folder to /SCRIPTS folder on on your radio
